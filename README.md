This book was created by me for elderly readers who need large text. 
The content is in Devanagari (Nepali) and was developed entirely from scratch.
Although I am not an expert in LaTeX, I completed this project efficiently. 
All files were generated using AI prompts, inspired by old pictures, 
and can be used for Nepali book writing, songbooks, or Vajan collections. 
A sample PDF with critical sections removed has also been uploaded.
